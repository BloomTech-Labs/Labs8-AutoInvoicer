#### Tech Stack

Auto-Invoicer is a MERN stack application. <br>

Due to the potential for high usage at key times of the year (e.g. the end of each quarter, the end of the fiscal year), MERN stack will offer the greatest uptime and concurrency handling. <br>

Mongo:
* Mongo DaaS provides 99.5% uptime. Users will be able access their invoices on demand with no worry about downtime. <br>
* Less room for error and delays in development with no join tables

Express:
* Highly extensible with NPM modules <br>
* Makes Node.js web app development fast and easy (get your product to the user quickly) <br>
* Allows you to define an error handling middleware <br>
* Easy to serve static files and resources <br>

React: <br>
* Is actively improved on by a larger number of developers due to high adoption rate, leading to better experience for end-users <br>
* High level of flexibility works well with ES6/ES7 syntax to manage high loads easily <br>
* Compiles to ES5 making it compatible back to IE9 <br>
* Virtual DOM also arranges documents of HTML, XHTML, or XML formats into a tree, which is more acceptable by web browsers while parsing different elements of the web application <br>
* Modular approach makes it highly customizable/extensible 

Node: <br>
* Node is known for offering high performance. It uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine which compiles directly into machine code. This increases the speed of execution. <br>
* The open source runtime environment of Node offers the facility of caching single modules. <br>
* Node offers the freedom to develop without imposed restrictions. Apps can be started from scratch. <br>
* Concurrency handling with Node's event loop is greater than what is offered by Ruby or Python. <br>
